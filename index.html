        <h2>About Minecraft</h2>
        <p>
          Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Markus Persson
          and now developed by Mojang Studios. The game allows players to
          explore dynamically generated worlds made from rough 3D cubes
          representing different materials such as dirt, stone, water, and wood.
          Players can gather resources, craft tools, build grand constructions,
          and battle creatures called mobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its open-ended gameplay encourages creativity, exploration, and
          collaboration, offering a vast and immersive experience for players of
          all ages worldwide.
